    <h2>What is lieglex?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Lieglex</b> is a software that helps organizations like NGOs, prisons, company cafeterias, hospitals, schools,
        and shelters manage food more efficiently.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using math-based optimization,
        we create balanced meal plans at the lowest possible cost,
        reducing waste and supporting the Zero Hunger (UN SDG 2) goal, especially in developing countries.
